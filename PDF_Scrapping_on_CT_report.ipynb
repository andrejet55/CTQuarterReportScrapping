At the same time, the investments we have made over the last two years \\n\\nposition us well, with better omnichannel experiences, higher customer satisfaction scores, and a \\n\\npositive reaction to new products as they hit our shelves.” \\n\\nTHIRD-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS \\n\\n•  Consolidated comparable sales were down 1.5%; SportChek grew for the first quarter since \\n\\nQ2 2023, which partially offset declines at Canadian Tire Retail (CTR) and Mark’s.  \\n\\no  CTR  comparable  sales1  were  down  2.2%,  compared  to  Q3  2023.

       " 'improved customer experience continued to be a focus and contributed to growth in \\n\\nathletic footwear and hockey categories. \\n\\no  Mark’s comparable sales1 were down 2.3%, led by industrial wear declines, which \\nwere partially offset by growth in men’s shorts and t-shirts. Children’s wear was a top \\n\\nperformer, as a result of the ongoing strategic rollout of the category to select Mark’s \\n\\nstores.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIncreased loyalty engagement saw active registered loyalty members up 4%; members took \\n\\nadvantage of 1:1 offers, engaged in mass Triangle promotions, and scanned their loyalty \\ncards more.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIn-store Net Promoter Score (NPS) was up across the Company’s banners, including CTR; \\n\\nstore investments and a focus on strong in-stock availability of key brands continued to drive \\nimprovements in positive customer sentiment.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nImproved retail profitability led to higher Consolidated Income Before Income taxes (IBT) at \\n$299.3  million,  an  increase  of  $230.0  million  and  $33.0  million  on  a  normalized  basis1 \\ncompared to the prior year.  \\n\\no  Retail  IBT  was  $164.8  million,  down  $74.2  million  and  up  $56.8  million  on  a \\nnormalized basis1. A strong retail gross margin rate1 combined with solid cost control \\noffset a decline in retail revenue. IBT also benefited from higher other income, which \\n\\nequated to around $0.41 of impact at the EPS level, as a result of a property sale \\ngain and insurance recoveries. \\n\\no  Financial Services IBT was $110.3 million in the quarter, a $15.4 million decrease \\nfrom  the  prior  year,  as  higher  net  write-offs  and  operating  expenses  were  only \\n\\npartially  offset  by  higher  revenues,  all  while  cardholder  engagement  remained \\nstrong.  Gross Average Accounts  Receivable1  (GAAR)  was  up  3.0%,  mainly  as  a \\nresult of higher average account balances. \\n\\n•  CTC continues to make solid progress on the key areas within its Better Connected strategy \\n\\nto enhance the customer experience and drive efficiencies, with almost $1.7 billion in capital \\ninvested since 2022. Accomplishments in the third quarter included:  \\n\\no  A  richer  in-store  and  digital  customer  experience:  Store  investments  are \\nproceeding at pace, with four new Party City stores added in Q3, and 39 CTR store \\n\\nrefresh projects expected to be completed by the end of 2024 (taking the total to 120 \\n\\nsince 2022). By year end, more than 90% of Canadian Tire’s 502 stores are expected \\n\\nto  have  deployed  technology  enhancements  such  as  electronic  shelf  labels  and \\n\\nlockers,  and  more  than  60%  of  CTC’s  1,400  retail  locations  will  have  enhanced \\nbroadband capabilities.  \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n',\n",
