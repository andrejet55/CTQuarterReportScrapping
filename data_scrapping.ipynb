       "\"   Canadian Tire Corporation Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results; Announces Annual Dividend Increase for 15th Consecutive Year and Share Repurchase Intention  Toronto, November 7, 2024 – Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited (TSX:CTC, TSX: CTC.A) (CTC or the Company) today released its third quarter results for the period ended September 28, 2024.    • Consolidated comparable sales1 trend improved compared to Q2 2024; consolidated comparable sales were down 1.5% compared to Q3 2023.  • Diluted and Normalized Earnings Per Share1 (EPS) were $3.59, compared to $(1.19) in Q3 2023, and up 21.3% from $2.96 on a normalized basis. • Annualized dividend increased from $7.00 to $7.10 per share, alongside an intention to repurchase up to $200.0 million of Class A Non-Voting Shares in 2025.   “We delivered strong retail profitability for the third consecutive quarter and sales trends improved,” said Greg Hicks, President and CEO, Canadian Tire Corporation. “With customer spending still constrained, Canadians are seeking value and finding it through Triangle Rewards, where more loyalty members earned and redeemed with us at higher levels this quarter.”   “We continue to control costs and manage margins carefully, in order to balance lingering consumer and economic headwinds. At the same time, the investments we have made over the last two years position us well, with better omnichannel experiences, higher customer satisfaction scores, and a positive reaction to new products as they hit our shelves.”  THIRD-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  • Consolidated comparable sales were down 1.5%; SportChek grew for the first quarter since Q2 2023, which partially offset declines at Canadian Tire Retail (CTR) and Mark’s.  o CTR comparable sales1 were down 2.2%, compared to Q3 2023. Customers continued to prioritize essential categories including Automotive, which continued to perform well against a strong quarter in Q3 2023, led by growth in automotive service. o SportChek comparable sales1 were up 2.9%, marking two consecutive quarters in which SportChek outperformed industry trends. Targeted promotional events and \\x0c 2  improved customer experience continued to be a focus and contributed to growth in athletic footwear and hockey categories. o Mark’s comparable sales1 were down 2.3%, led by industrial wear declines, which were partially offset by growth in men’s shorts and t-shirts. Children’s wear was a top performer, as a result of the ongoing strategic rollout of the category to select Mark’s stores.  • Increased loyalty engagement saw active registered loyalty members up 4%; members took advantage of 1:1 offers, engaged in mass Triangle promotions, and scanned their loyalty cards more.  • In-store Net Promoter Score (NPS) was up across the Company’s banners, including CTR; store investments and a focus on strong in-stock availability of key brands continued to drive improvements in positive customer sentiment.  • Improved retail profitability led to higher Consolidated Income Before Income taxes (IBT) at $299.3 million, an increase of $230.0 million and $33.0 million on a normalized basis1 compared to the prior year.  o Retail IBT was $164.8 million, down $74.2 million and up $56.8 million on a normalized basis1. A strong retail gross margin rate1 combined with solid cost control offset a decline in retail revenue. IBT also benefited from higher other income, which equated to around $0.41 of impact at the EPS level, as a result of a property sale gain and insurance recoveries. o Financial Services IBT was $110.3 million in the quarter, a $15.4 million decrease from the prior year, as higher net write-offs and operating expenses were only partially offset by higher revenues, all while cardholder engagement remained strong. Gross Average Accounts Receivable1 (GAAR) was up 3.0%, mainly as a result of higher average account balances. • CTC continues to make solid progress on the key areas within its Better Connected strategy to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiencies, with almost $1.7 billion in capital invested since 2022. Accomplishments in the third quarter included:  o A richer in-store and digital customer experience: Store investments are proceeding at pace, with four new Party City stores added in Q3, and 39 CTR store refresh projects expected to be completed by the end of 2024 (taking the total to 120 since 2022). By year end, more than 90% of Canadian Tire’s 502 stores are expected to have deployed technology enhancements such as electronic shelf labels and lockers, and more than 60% of CTC’s 1,400 retail locations will have enhanced broadband capabilities.  \\x0c 3  o Improved supply chain productivity: Previously announced supply chain investments and consolidation are improving productivity and savings, including increased throughput as a result of goods-to-person automation, which is now fully operational at the Company’s Calgary and Montreal Distribution Centres (DC). The last stage of planned supply chain investments will include the phased rollout of CTC’s new transportation management system, and a new Vancouver DC set to open in 2025.   o Continued margin accretion from Owned Brands successes: Continued strength in categories like automotive and hockey is contributing to margin accretion, with Owned Brand penetration1 relatively flat despite pressure in some discretionary categories. A pipeline of innovative and quality Owned Brand products are set to roll out during 2025. CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW • Revenue was $4,192.9 million, down 1.4% compared to $4,250.5 million in the same period last year; Revenue (excluding Petroleum)1 was $3,639.8 million, a decrease of 0.4% compared to the prior year. • Consolidated income before income taxes was $299.3 million, up $230.0 million compared to the prior year.

At the same time, the investments we have made over the last two years \\n\\nposition us well, with better omnichannel experiences, higher customer satisfaction scores, and a \\n\\npositive reaction to new products as they hit our shelves.” \\n\\nTHIRD-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS \\n\\n•  Consolidated comparable sales were down 1.5%; SportChek grew for the first quarter since \\n\\nQ2 2023, which partially offset declines at Canadian Tire Retail (CTR) and Mark’s.  \\n\\no  CTR  comparable  sales1  were  down  2.2%,  compared  to  Q3  2023.

       " 'improved customer experience continued to be a focus and contributed to growth in \\n\\nathletic footwear and hockey categories. \\n\\no  Mark’s comparable sales1 were down 2.3%, led by industrial wear declines, which \\nwere partially offset by growth in men’s shorts and t-shirts. Children’s wear was a top \\n\\nperformer, as a result of the ongoing strategic rollout of the category to select Mark’s \\n\\nstores.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIncreased loyalty engagement saw active registered loyalty members up 4%; members took \\n\\nadvantage of 1:1 offers, engaged in mass Triangle promotions, and scanned their loyalty \\ncards more.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIn-store Net Promoter Score (NPS) was up across the Company’s banners, including CTR; \\n\\nstore investments and a focus on strong in-stock availability of key brands continued to drive \\nimprovements in positive customer sentiment.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nImproved retail profitability led to higher Consolidated Income Before Income taxes (IBT) at \\n$299.3  million,  an  increase  of  $230.0  million  and  $33.0  million  on  a  normalized  basis1 \\ncompared to the prior year.  \\n\\no  Retail  IBT  was  $164.8  million,  down  $74.2  million  and  up  $56.8  million  on  a \\nnormalized basis1. A strong retail gross margin rate1 combined with solid cost control \\noffset a decline in retail revenue. IBT also benefited from higher other income, which \\n\\nequated to around $0.41 of impact at the EPS level, as a result of a property sale \\ngain and insurance recoveries. \\n\\no  Financial Services IBT was $110.3 million in the quarter, a $15.4 million decrease \\nfrom  the  prior  year,  as  higher  net  write-offs  and  operating  expenses  were  only \\n\\npartially  offset  by  higher  revenues,  all  while  cardholder  engagement  remained \\nstrong.  Gross Average Accounts  Receivable1  (GAAR)  was  up  3.0%,  mainly  as  a \\nresult of higher average account balances. \\n\\n•  CTC continues to make solid progress on the key areas within its Better Connected strategy \\n\\nto enhance the customer experience and drive efficiencies, with almost $1.7 billion in capital \\ninvested since 2022. Accomplishments in the third quarter included:  \\n\\no  A  richer  in-store  and  digital  customer  experience:  Store  investments  are \\nproceeding at pace, with four new Party City stores added in Q3, and 39 CTR store \\n\\nrefresh projects expected to be completed by the end of 2024 (taking the total to 120 \\n\\nsince 2022). By year end, more than 90% of Canadian Tire’s 502 stores are expected \\n\\nto  have  deployed  technology  enhancements  such  as  electronic  shelf  labels  and \\n\\nlockers,  and  more  than  60%  of  CTC’s  1,400  retail  locations  will  have  enhanced \\nbroadband capabilities.  \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n',\n",

At the same time, the investments we have made over the last two years \\n\\nposition us well, with better omnichannel experiences, higher customer satisfaction scores, and a \\n\\npositive reaction to new products as they hit our shelves.” \\n\\nTHIRD-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS \\n\\n•  Consolidated comparable sales were down 1.5%; SportChek grew for the first quarter since \\n\\nQ2 2023, which partially offset declines at Canadian Tire Retail (CTR) and Mark’s.  \\n\\no  CTR  comparable  sales1  were  down  2.2%,  compared  to  Q3  2023.  Customers \\ncontinued to prioritize essential categories including Automotive, which continued to \\n\\nperform  well  against  a  strong  quarter  in  Q3  2023,  led  by  growth  in  automotive \\n\\nservice. \\n\\no  SportChek comparable sales1 were up 2.9%, marking two consecutive quarters in \\nwhich  SportChek  outperformed  industry  trends.  Targeted  promotional  events  and \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\nimproved customer experience continued to be a focus and contributed to growth in \\n\\nathletic footwear and hockey categories. \\n\\no  Mark’s comparable sales1 were down 2.3%, led by industrial wear declines, which \\nwere partially offset by growth in men’s shorts and t-shirts. Children’s wear was a top \\n\\nperformer, as a result of the ongoing strategic rollout of the category to select Mark’s \\n\\nstores.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIncreased loyalty engagement saw active registered loyalty members up 4%; members took \\n\\nadvantage of 1:1 offers, engaged in mass Triangle promotions, and scanned their loyalty \\ncards more.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nIn-store Net Promoter Score (NPS) was up across the Company’s banners, including CTR; \\n\\nstore investments and a focus on strong in-stock availability of key brands continued to drive \\nimprovements in positive customer sentiment.  \\n\\n• \\n\\nImproved retail profitability led to higher Consolidated Income Before Income taxes (IBT) at \\n$299.3  million,  an  increase  of  $230.0  million  and  $33.0  million  on  a  normalized  basis1 \\ncompared to the prior year.  \\n\\no  Retail  IBT  was  $164.8  million,  down  $74.2  million  and  up  $56.8  million  on  a \\nnormalized basis1. A strong retail gross margin rate1 combined with solid cost control \\noffset a decline in retail revenue. IBT also benefited from higher other income, which \\n\\nequated to around $0.41 of impact at the EPS level, as a result of a property sale \\ngain and insurance recoveries. \\n\\no  Financial Services IBT was $110.3 million in the quarter, a $15.4 million decrease \\nfrom  the  prior  year,  as  higher  net  write-offs  and  operating  expenses  were  only \\n\\npartially  offset  by  higher  revenues,  all  while  cardholder  engagement  remained \\nstrong.  Gross Average Accounts  Receivable1  (GAAR)  was  up  3.0%,  mainly  as  a \\nresult of higher average account balances. \\n\\n•  CTC continues to make solid progress on the key areas within its Better Connected strategy \\n\\nto enhance the customer experience and drive efficiencies, with almost $1.7 billion in capital \\ninvested since 2022. Accomplishments in the third quarter included:  \\n\\no  A  richer  in-store  and  digital  customer  experience:  Store  investments  are \\nproceeding at pace, with four new Party City stores added in Q3, and 39 CTR store \\n\\nrefresh projects expected to be completed by the end of 2024 (taking the total to 120 \\n\\nsince 2022). By year end, more than 90% of Canadian Tire’s 502 stores are expected \\n\\nto  have  deployed  technology  enhancements  such  as  electronic  shelf  labels  and \\n\\nlockers,  and  more  than  60%  of  CTC’s  1,400  retail  locations  will  have  enhanced \\nbroadband capabilities.  \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n\\no \\n\\nImproved  supply  chain  productivity:  Previously  announced  supply  chain \\ninvestments  and  consolidation  are  improving  productivity  and  savings,  including \\n\\nincreased throughput as a result of goods-to-person automation, which is now fully \\n\\noperational at the Company’s Calgary and Montreal Distribution Centres (DC).
