“We delivered strong retail profitability for the third consecutive quarter and sales trends improved,” said Greg Hicks, President and CEO, Canadian Tire Corporation. “With customer spending still constrained, Canadians are seeking value and finding it through Triangle Rewards, where more loyalty members earned and redeemed with us at higher levels this quarter. ” 
  
“We continue to control costs and manage margins carefully, in order to balance lingering consumer 
and economic headwinds. At the same time, the investments we have made over the last two years 
position us well, with better omnichannel experiences, higher customer satisfaction scores, and a positive reaction to new products  as they hit our shelves .” 
 THIRD- QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  
 
• Consolidated comparable sales were down 1.5% ; SportChek grew  for the first quarter since 
Q2 2023, which partially offset declines at Canadian Tire Retail ( CTR)  and Mark’s.  
o CTR comparable sales
1 were down 2.2%, compared to  Q3 2023. Customers 
continued to prioritize  essential  categories  including Automotive, which  continued to  
perform well against a  strong quarter in Q3 2023, led by growth in automotive 
service.  
o SportChek comparable sales1 were up 2.9% , marking two consecutive quarters in 
which  SportChek outperformed industry trends . Targeted promotional events and 
 
2 
 improved customer experience continued to be a focus and contributed to  growth in 
athletic footwear  and hockey  categories . 
o Mark’s comparable sales1 were down 2.3% , led by industrial wear  declines , which 
were partially  offset by growth in men’s shorts and t-shirts . Children’s wear was a top 
performer , as a result of  the ongoing strategic rollout of the category to select Mark’s 
stores.  
• Increased l oyalty engagement saw a ctive registered loyalty members up  4%; members took  
advantage of 1:1 offers, engaged in mass Triangle promotions , and scanned their loyalty 
cards more .  
• In-store Net Promoter Score (NPS) was up across the Company’s banners , including CTR ; 
store investments and a focus on strong in- stock availability of key brands continued to dr ive 
improvements in positive customer sentiment.  
• Improved retail profitability led to higher  Consolidated Income Before Income taxes (IBT)  at 
$299.3 million, an increase of  $230.0 million  and $33.0 million  on a normalized basis1 
compared to the prior year.   
o Retail IBT was $164.8 million, down  $74.2 million  and up $56.8 million  on a 
normalized basis1. A strong  retail gross margin rate1 combined with solid cost control  
offset  a decline in retail revenue. IBT also benefited from higher other income,  which 
equated to around $0.41 of impact at the EPS level , as a result of a  property sale  
gain and insurance recoveries . 
o Financial Services IBT was $110.3 million in the quarter, a $15.4 million decrease 
from the prior year, as higher net write -offs and operating expenses were only 
partially offset by higher revenues, all while cardholder engagement remained 
strong.  Gross Average Accounts Receivable1 (GAAR) was up 3.0%, mainly as a 
result of higher  average account balances.  
• CTC continues to make solid progress on the key areas within its Better Connected  strategy 
to enhance the customer experience and drive efficiencies , with almost $1.7 billion in capital 
invested since 2022. Accomplishments in the third quarter  included:  
o A richer in- store and digital customer experience:  Store investments are 
proceeding at pace, with four new Party City stores added in Q3, and 39 CTR store 
refresh projects expected to be completed by the end of 2024 (taking the total to 120 
since 2022) . By year end, more than 90% of Canadian Tire’s  502 stores are expected 
to have deployed technology enhancements such as electronic shelf labels and 
lockers , and more than 60% of CTC’s 1,400 retail locations  will have  enhanced  
broadband capabilities .   
3 
 o Improved supply chain productivity:  Previously announced  supply chain 
investments and consolidation are  improving  productivity  and savings , including 
increased throughput  as a result of goods -to-person automation, which is now fully 
operational  at the Company’s Calgary and Montreal Distribution Centres  (DC) . The 
last stage of planned supply  chain investment s will include the  phased rollout of 
CTC’s  new transportation management system , and a new Vancouver DC set to 
open in 2025.   
o Continued margin accretion from Owned Brands successes: Continued 
strength in categories like automotive and hockey  is contributing to margin accretion, 
with Owned Brand penetration1 relatively flat  despite pressure in some discretionary 
categories . A pipeline of innovative and quality Owned Brand products are set to roll 
out during 2025.
